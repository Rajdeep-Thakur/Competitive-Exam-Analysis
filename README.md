# Competitive-Exam-Analysis
The competitive exams all around the world hardly ever take into account just one aspect of preparation and rather test the overall aptitude of the candidate. The model tries to mimic the real world model as closely as possible.

Let us assume that an entrance exam has 140 questions with a limited time of 250 minutes to complete the paper, all with equal weightage of marks. 

If a person has higher hardwork, he/she can get through the easier and medium difficulty questions with ease. If the person is naturally intelligent, then he can answer more difficult questions. A person who has luck on his favour has a slightly better performance than usual. The facilities indicate all the other factors, be it moral support or academic support.

+3 marks per correct answer, 0 per unanswered and -1 per wrongly answered question.
A small bonus is added on the basis of the difficulty of the question

A shifted normal distribution is assumed for the distribution of these parameters among the applicants.
The paper is divided into easy, medium and difficult questions. 
50 easy questions
60 medium questions
30 difficult questions

Also, the more hardworking, intelligent and better facilities, the better they are at time management

Probability to score a question correctly, Time taken per question, Question Choosing, Probability of skipping a question in which the student was getting negative marks all are appropriately weighted against the hardwork, intelligence, facilities and external luck factor they have on that day.
